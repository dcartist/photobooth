               During the pandemic, three strangers met online—bonding over late-night chats, shared laughter, and an undeniable spark of creativity. What started as casual conversations soon became something special: a friendship built on spontaneity, trust, and a shared vision for something bigger.

            One day, amid our usual banter, the topic of photobooths came up. The idea was thrilling, yet wildly improbable—until February 2025 arrived, and we took the leap. We turned our conversation into reality,  fueled by a belief that every captured memory should be as glamorous as the moment itself.
